## Graduate Admission Predictor for student and University

<b> Goal</b><br>
The goal of the model is to cover two aspects of Graduate Admission:<br>
 - Students : Building a Machine Learning model to help the aspiring graduate students to narrow down the universities choices in Computer Science in USA<br>
 - University: Building a Machine Learning model to assist the university in selecting suitable candidates for the CS Program<br>

<b> Approach </b><br>
- Data Gathering : Scraped the dataset from Yocket, Edulix which consists of 9 columns and 9351 for 29 universities in USA<br>
- Data cleaning, Data Processing feature Engineering<br>
- Data Models for students and University : Classification Models<br>
- Error metrices calculation: Using confusion metrix to calculate Accuracy,F1 score and AUC curve<br>
- Pipeling: Using Dask for Pipelining<br>
- Dockerizing: Dockerizing the environment<br>
- Deployment: deploying the code on Heroku and Amazon AWS S3<br>

<b> DataSet Used</b><br>
 - Assisting Student Model : Dataset for 29 colleges across USA ranging from Rank 1 to Rank 130 in computer science department<br>
 - Assidting University Model: Dataset for Northeastern University, Boston<br>
